<H2>Browse For Speed 0.3 - Released!</H2>
</p>
<p><a href='/files/browseforspeed-0.3.zip'>Browse for Speed 0.3</a> - The main program files. This requires .NET 2.0 - see below for a direct download link.</p>
<p>Well, version 0.2 didn't last very long at all, not because it needed bugs fixed, but because we have implemented some features we would like to be made available now. Changelog from 0.2:
<ul>
	<li>Pubstat queries are cached by the library, so if you do lots of view server informations in quick succession, the pubstat system will not tell you to go and sit in the corner.</li>
	<li>Added a friends system. Similar to the alert system on LFSWorld, this will show you if any of your friends are racing, and some information about the server they are racing on.</li>
	<li>Track information in the display shows the full track name.</li>
	<li>Fixed crash when sorting by car names, then clicking favourites tab.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Upgrade instructions: (from any version)</strong> Simply unzip into your existing folder, overwriting any files.</p>
