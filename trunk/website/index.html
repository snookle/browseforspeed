<p>Browse For Speed is a server browser for the popular online racing sim Live For Speed. It is able to query demo/s1/s2 servers, lets you maintain a favourites list and keeps track of your friends. It also has an admin interface to allow you to control your server via Insim. See the screenshots/FAQ for more features.</p>
