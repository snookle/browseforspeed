<p> Arne Claassen's <a href='http://www.claassen.net/geek/lfs/'>Insim Library</a>. This library is used by the admin interface. The LFSLib.dll distributed with Browse For Speed is modified. To build it, download 0.11b from his site and our <a href="/files/relaypatch.diff.txt">patch</a>.
<p> The library was developed with <a href='http://www.monodevelop.com/Main_Page'>MonoDevelop</a>, and requires .NET 1.1. The front-end code requires .NET 2.0. This is the first project we have ever written in c#.
