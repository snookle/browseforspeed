<p>Browse For Speed is a server browser for the popular online racing sim Live For Speed. It is able to query demo/s1/s2 servers, lets you maintain a favourites list and keeps track of your friends. It also has an admin interface to allow you to control your server via Insim. See the screenshots/FAQ for more features.</p>

<H2>Browse For Speed 0.7!</H2>
</p>
<p><a href='/files/browseforspeed-0.7.zip'>Browse for Speed 0.7</a> - The main program files. This requires .NET 2.0 - see below for a direct download link.</p>
<p>Version 0.7 is out! Changelog from 0.6:
<ul>
    <li>Fix encoding problems</li>
    <li>Speed up list drawing, especially friends</li>
    <li>Coloured hostnames</li>
    <li>Supports all the characters found in LFS (providing you have appropriate fonts installed)</li>
	<li>Favourite list includes Version column</li>
</ul>
<p>
If you want to be able to see all characters (Japanese, Cryllic etc) properly, you need to install additional font support. Click Start-&gt;Control Panel-&gt;Regional and language Options-&gt;Languages and check the two checkboxes in "Supplemental language support". You will need your Windows install CD. You need to reboot for this support to work properly. Doing this will also enable you to see the characters properly on LFSWorld.<br/>
Note that not installing this won't affect functionality of BFS, you will simply not be able to see these characters (they'll show up as a square).
</p>
<p><strong>Upgrade instructions: (from any version)</strong> Simply unzip into your existing folder, overwriting any files.</p>

<p> The library was developed with <a href='http://www.monodevelop.com/Main_Page'>MonoDevelop</a>, and requires .NET 1.1. The front-end code requires .NET 2.0. This is the first project we have ever written in c#.
