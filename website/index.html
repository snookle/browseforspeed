<p>Browse For Speed is a server browser for the popular online racing sim Live For Speed. It is able to query demo/s1/s2 servers, lets you maintain a favourites list and keeps track of your friends. It also has an admin interface to allow you to control your server via Insim. See the screenshots/FAQ for more features.</p>

<p> Arne Claassen's <a href='http://www.claassen.net/geek/lfs/'>Insim Library</a>. This library is used by the admin interface. The LFSLib.dll distributed with Browse For Speed is modified. To build it, download 0.11b from his site and our <a href="/files/relaypatch.diff.txt">patch</a>.
<p> The library was developed with <a href='http://www.monodevelop.com/Main_Page'>MonoDevelop</a>, and requires .NET 1.1. The front-end code requires .NET 2.0. This is the first project we have ever written in c#.
